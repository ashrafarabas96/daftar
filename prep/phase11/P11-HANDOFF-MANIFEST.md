# P11 — HANDOFF MANIFEST

**Required gate.** PART 13 of the 2026-10-12 per-phase directive makes a `P<N>-HANDOFF-MANIFEST.md` mandatory for every Phase 5–15 preparation; a missing artifact is **`HANDOFF INCOMPLETE`**, which the directive is explicit is *not* automatically product failure. The purpose is that the next reader — a successor agent, a challenger, the coordinator, or the Migration Owner at promotion — can tell what exists, where, and whether it is in Git, **without re-deriving any of it**. The directive's own instruction is to search before recreating: the current branch, the worktree, the previous report bundle, the shared project-files location, and the local commit history, in that order.

## 1. Identity

| field | value |
|---|---|
| **phase** | 11 — Apparel · Electronics · Repair · Lot/Expiry vertical packs (Master Part 31) |
| **status** | **`PREPARED / NOT PROMOTED`** — `DESIGN / SPEC ONLY`. One subfeature is separately `BLOCKED` (repair-part accounting, PART 68) and two are `WAITING_FOR_INTEGRATED_SURFACE` (the preconsumed billing binding and the repair deposit, both on unsealed Phase 4 surfaces). PART 117 states the law this obeys: never call `PREPARED` complete, never call a local test CI, never call a spec a DB proof. |
| **base read** | `93084f8` on `phase/4-sales-pos-customers-receivables` (`fix(p4s1-gate): a delegator may not also compute`) |
| **own branch** | `claude/phase11-prep-re0epv`, cut from that head. Nothing has been pushed to `phase/4-sales-pos-customers-receivables` or to `main`, and no pull request exists. |
| **worktree** | the session's primary checkout at `/home/user/daftar`; no separate git worktree was created |
| **preparation SHA — the six documents of 2026-10-08** | `6958b886aba8fb918bf18e6e0eac451438910ec1` (parent `188dcb076c16035ab2db9a138b2b2c4dc84bcc2b`) |
| **preparation SHA — this revision (2026-10-12, the per-phase directive applied)** | the commit that adds this manifest and the seven revised documents under `prep/phase11/`. It is the child of `6958b88` on this branch; `git log --oneline -1 claude/phase11-prep-re0epv` prints it, and the Arabic report's accompanying message to the Tech Lead states it. **This manifest does not quote its own commit SHA**, because a file cannot contain the hash of the commit that creates it, and inventing one would be exactly the kind of unverifiable number this project refuses. |
| **push authority** | `TL-MASS-PRESERVE-01` (§9 of the 2026-10-08 directive): a PREPARED / NOT PROMOTED prep thread may fast-forward push **its own isolated prep branch** for preservation — non-canonical, not `main`, not the Phase 4 branch, no PR, no force, no rewrite, not integration, exact SHA recorded. **Preservation, not promotion.** This branch never merges itself. |
| **migration numbers** | **none allocated, none reserved, none examined, none exampled, none in a filename and none in a comment.** Every number appearing in any Phase 11 document is a citation to a file already on disk. One Migration Owner, at promotion (PART 6). |
| **frozen prefix** | `0000`–`0079` are byte-immutable and **were not modified, not even temporarily, and not by any test** — no Phase 11 proof targets them (see `P11-AL-25` and §0a of the laws document). `0080`–`0086` are Phase 4's unfrozen S4 candidates and were likewise not touched. |
| **timing / performance** | **no number measured and none claimed anywhere.** This container is not the authoritative box and a figure from it would not be comparable. A budget *lane* is owed from the Performance Owner. |

## 2. Artifacts

Each document exists in **two places**: the shared project-files location (the canonical working copy) and `prep/phase11/` in Git on the prep branch. The SHA256 is of the shared copy as of this revision; the Git copies are byte-identical, which is what the commit proves.

| artifact | shared location | in Git | SHA256 (shared copy) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `P11-S0-VERTICAL-PACK-ARCHITECTURE.md` | `/mnt/project-files/phase11/` | `prep/phase11/` — **committed** | `f07fb2213cf63581c91110a93cdc39a0e879c9abb3e13869b8ebcab603882eea` |
| `P11-MIGRATION-PATCH-REQUEST.md` | `/mnt/project-files/phase11/` | `prep/phase11/` — **committed** | `487811213a39b7ce5c4cf1d604e6089e5a221aab93038bb27cd196e1cc21cefc` |
| `P11-CONSERVATION-LAWS-AND-RED-PROOFS.md` | `/mnt/project-files/phase11/` | `prep/phase11/` — **committed** | `23decb052b80ce342e44f7cc46f6ba28ec9af41cc455fbe526d6d26afc1fbe87` |
| `P11-TASK-DAG.md` | `/mnt/project-files/phase11/` | `prep/phase11/` — **committed** | `5f0875dff1fc1e2ef3aaadc7c12851a9bd604ab8ad934069ec6c553c3472e24f` |
| `P11-OPEN-DECISIONS.md` | `/mnt/project-files/phase11/` | `prep/phase11/` — **committed** | `4f34ccc48036aee0270beac7545428fce844811c6746f3973d665dc9f795f6bf` |
| `P11-S0-REPORT-AR.md` | `/mnt/project-files/phase11/` | `prep/phase11/` — **committed** | `30aa4a4e1af18d5b0263b7d809a0e8dafbd1aed58a2732bf21eae29ca421eb1b` |
| `P11-HANDOFF-MANIFEST.md` (this file) | `/mnt/project-files/phase11/` | `prep/phase11/` — **committed** | self-referential; recompute with `sha256sum` |

**Nothing is uncommitted.** The working tree is clean at the preparation SHA, and the shared copies are the same bytes. Note that `/mnt/project-files/` is **not in Git**: the Git copies under `prep/phase11/` are the durable ones, and that duplication exists precisely because this container is ephemeral.

**Where to look first if an artifact appears to be missing** (PART 13's order, and its warning that a referenced companion document absent from an archive does **not** mean the work never existed): `git show <prep SHA>:prep/phase11/` on this branch; then `/mnt/project-files/phase11/`; then `git log --all --diff-filter=A -- 'prep/phase11/*'`. Do not recreate any of these until that search proves the file absent.

## 3. Evidence files

**There are none, and that is the honest state.** No DDL has been applied to a cluster, no suite has been executed, no gate script exists, and no CI run is attached. Every verdict in every Phase 11 document is labelled `SPEC ONLY`, `DESIGN ONLY`, `UNMEASURED`, `BLOCKED` or `WAITING_FOR_INTEGRATED_SURFACE`, never two classes in one sentence (§82).

What is owed, and by whom, is in `P11-CONSERVATION-LAWS-AND-RED-PROOFS.md` §3 as a T0–T7 estate. The first execution step is fixed by §12 of the master directive and by `P11-AL-19`: apply the Phase 11 DDL **as `daftar_migrator`, the application role and the internal roles — never superuser-only** — on a scratch cluster and read the earliest error, *before* any TypeScript. The nearby precedent is the one that justifies the order: eight of twelve defects in a comparable slice were found that way, two of them exactly the shapes this DDL invites (a constraint trigger created above its function, and RLS forced with no policy so the validator refuses everything rather than only the incomplete cases).

---

## 4. Migration patch request

`P11-MIGRATION-PATCH-REQUEST.md` — numberless by law. It specifies four packs (apparel axes and the canonicalization trigger; lot/expiry relations, deferred conservation triggers, fold/verify/pick; serial registry and the append-only custody chain; repair tickets, the parts bridge, the preconsumed billing binding, warranty and its lifecycle chain), the RLS and grants shape copied verbatim rather than reinvented, the ownership bracket, and a **17-item end-state assertion** that refuses the migration rather than warning.

Six questions for the Migration Owner, `MPR-01` … `MPR-06` (§10). `MPR-05` and `MPR-06` are new on 2026-10-12: respectively, confirmation that Phase 11 creates **no** money relation for the deposit (PART 69), and whether the warranty pack is allocated **after** the Phase 4 sale-line seal so its anchor FK is to frozen columns (recommended) rather than added by a follow-up, which would leave a window in which an unanchored warranty is representable.

**One core routine must be re-created** (`CREATE OR REPLACE`) rather than extended from outside: the single stock writer, so it can accept lot assignments and serial events. The patch request specifies the request type's extension **without any change to the return shape**, states its predecessor as "the live effective definition at allocation time" rather than a number, and names every routine it re-creates with the reason.

---

## 5. Shared-file patch requests

Phase 11 writes nothing outside its own prefix. Four changes it needs in files other threads own are stated as **patch requests to the owner**, per §78/§80 — never applied here, and a result resting on one is `CONDITIONAL`:

| file | owner | what Phase 11 needs |
|---|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | CI Owner | the Phase 11 gate as an **unconditional** step of the required `backend` job, after its predecessor; no `if:`, no `continue-on-error` (task `P11-GATE-004`) |
| `packages/domain-core/src/capabilities.ts` | Domain-core owner | a `repairs` capability definition — named in that file's header comment but absent from `DEFINITIONS` — and the capability↔feature mapping that **nothing in the repository currently provides** |
| `packages/domain-core/src/industry-profiles.ts` | Domain-core owner | a `repair` industry profile key |
| the `features` registry (a migration row, not code) | Migration Owner | a repair feature key, and `VARIANT_MATRIX`, which is unregistered while the registry is an FK target — so an unregistered key is refused by the database itself |

---

## 6. Open decisions

**One is with the owner** and it is business/legal by nature: **`OD-P11-07`** — what the business owes if a customer's device in custody is lost, damaged or never collected, and after how long an uncollected device may be treated as abandoned. PART 116 names `customer-device liability` among the only classes an owner is interrupted for, and names nothing else in Phase 11's scope. **Nothing in Phase 11 is blocked on the answer:** custody states, timestamps and actors are recorded faithfully and append-only, the terminal state is the neutral `uncollected` rather than the legal conclusion `abandoned`, and no liability amount is computed. The day the answer arrives it is a policy value and possibly one new state, not a redesign.

**Everything else is ruled:** `ADJ-P11-01` (Option B) and `OD-P11-01` … `OD-P11-06` by `TL-P11-R1` … `TL-P11-R6`, plus `TL-P11-R7` and §55/§60/§62/§63, plus PARTs 62–71 of 2026-10-12. The full record, including the defects returned with each ruling, is `P11-OPEN-DECISIONS.md`.

**One is with the Accounting Owner, not the Tech Lead:** the repair-part posting map (PART 68) — the inventory credit, the expense/COGS/WIP debit per the accepted model, the moving-average valuation source, the correction/reversal path, and no invoice-time duplicate COGS. Phase 11 does not guess the debit. Per `P11-AL-24` this blocks **that subfeature only**, not the phase.

---

## 7. Challenger state

**No challenger has reviewed this preparation.** An author does not sign their own work, and nothing here carries a second signature, let alone a third. PART 118 lists **Challenger on design** among the immediate Phase 11 items, and it is startable now because its subject is these seven documents rather than code: task `P11-REP-014`. The fail-open cases to attack, named in advance so the challenger need not find the list first:

1. a billing binding created **before** its consumption exists (`P11-AL-21` condition 7) — re-opens the §60 defect by another door;
2. a binding across **two customers**, which no single-customer fixture can expose (condition 3b, new on PART 67);
3. a warranty row **deleted** by a return path (`C-WAR-01` case d) — the first draft's shape;
4. a proof whose mutation lands in **frozen history** (`P11-AL-25`, §0a of the laws document);
5. `C-SER-03` satisfied by **zero** serial events on some writer branch — silent, permanent overlay drift;
6. `C-LOT-03`'s per-lot cache disagreeing with `stock_levels` — a second quantity truth wearing a cache's clothes.

## 8. Coordinator state

**No coordinator signature.** Phase 11 cannot promote: Phase 4 is not sealed and Phases 5–10 have not started, and §88's promotion order is serial even though preparation is parallel. The coordinator's involvement so far has been to relay the two directives and to ask that the per-phase one be applied here; no verdict has been signed on this phase by anyone.

## 9. Unresolved blockers

| blocker | class | owner | blocks |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 4 not sealed | sequencing | Phase 4 thread | all promotion. The billing binding's FK and the warranty anchor both point at Phase 4 sale lines |
| Phase 4 payment / customer-credit contract not sealed | `WAITING_FOR_INTEGRATED_SURFACE` | Phase 4 | the repair deposit flow (`P11-REP-012`). The design is settled; the surface is not |
| Phase 10 `SERVICE` stock-effect capability not sealed | `BLOCKED` | Phase 10 | repair labour as a service product (`P11-REP-010`). Phase 11 registers nothing dead in Phase 10 for it |
| repair-part posting map unruled | `BLOCKED` (one subfeature) | **Accounting Owner** | registering `repair_part_consumption` and anything posting through it. Explicitly **not** the rest of the phase (PART 68, `P11-AL-24`) |
| `OD-P11-07` customer-device liability | owner-only | **Tech Lead / legal** | nothing. Recorded so it is not mistaken for an engineering gap |
| capability↔feature vocabulary unmapped | shared-file patch request | Domain-core owner | every pack screen's gating. Startable now (`P11-CAP-002`) |
| the Phase 11 gate is not a required CI step | shared-file patch request | CI Owner | the gate's own authority. A gate CI does not run is `UNMEASURED`, never green |

**Not a blocker, recorded so it is not silently corrected by the wrong hand:** the canonical status page at this head still describes the S4 candidates as three while the tree carries seven. The live code is the fact; that page belongs to the coordinator.
